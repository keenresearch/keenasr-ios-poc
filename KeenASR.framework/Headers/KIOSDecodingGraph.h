/** AlternativePronunciation is a class that defines mapping beween a word and its phonetic
 pronunciation. Phonetic pronunciation is a space separated string of phonemes that define how the word is
 pronounced. The names of the phonemes are defined in ASR Bundle lang/phones.txt file. For some languages
 for which this mapping is not deterministic, ASR Bundle will contain a large lookup table in lang/lexicon.txt file.
 
 You can use AlternativePronunciations to provide alternatives to existing pronunciations, to define
 pronunciations for the words that are not in the lexicon.txt file (including made-up words), or to provide
 common mispronunciations (which can be useful in some scenarios such as language learning and reading
 instruction); For the latter, you can also provide a tag when defining AlternativePronunciation; if such
 alternative pronunciation is recognized by the recognizer, the # symbol and the provided tag will be appended
 to the word in the result (e.g. "PEAK#WRONG", if the tag was set to "WRONG").
 
 Example:
 
 ```
    KIOSAlternativePronunciation *ap = [KIOSAlternativePronunciation new];
    ap.word = @"PEAK";
    ap.pronunciation = @"P IH0 K";
    ap.tag = @"WRONG";
 ```

/** KIOSDecodingGraph class manages decoding graphs in the filesystem.
 
 You can use  various KIOSDecodingGraph class methods to  create decoding graphs, which will be saved in
 the filesystem on the device. Typically, you will  provide a list of phrases to
 createDecodingGraphFromPhrases:forRecognizer:andSaveWithName: method, which will then create a
 decoding graph in the filesystem. Later on, you can refer  to the  decoding graph by its name.

 Contextual graphs are a composition of multiple decoding graphs in a single graph. If your application needs to
 create multiple decoding graphs often it may be more efficient to create a single contextual decoding graph
 instead and then switch the contexts as needed. A good example would be a digital book; each page presented
 to the user would be a single context and you would switch contexts as the app (or user) changes the pages.
 The trade-offs with contextual graphs is that creating one with N contexts will be much faster than creation of a
 single graph N times; the downside is that there will be a small penalty (delay of 100ms or so) when switching
 between different contexts.
 
 @note When dynamically creating decoding graphs, any words that do not have
 phonetic representation in the lexicon (`ASRBUNDLE/lang/lexicon.txt`) will be
 assigned one algorithmically. For English langauge algorithmic representation is
 imperfect, thus you should aim to use KIOSAlternative prounciations to augment the  lexicon with
 words that are likely to be encountered in your app. For example, if your app is dealing with ASR of names
 you would augment the lexicon with additional names and their proper  pronunciation before releasing your app.

 @note For the large number of phrases (e.g. several thousands), creating of decoding graph can
 take several seconds on older devices.
 
 @note Decoding graphs can also be created ahead of time and packaged with the application.
