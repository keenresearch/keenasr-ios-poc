/** KIOSDecodingGraph class manages decoding graphs in the filesystem. For more
 details on the concept of decoding graphs in automated speech recognition see 
 [this page](http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/graph.html).
 
 For ASR tasks in which domain and vocabulary are defined ahead of time and not
 dependent on information available only during the runtime, it is recommended that
 decoding graph is created offline and packaged in the ASR bundle directory.
 
 If user specific information is necessary to create decoding graphs, you can use
 various KIOSDecodingGraph class methods to dynamically create decoding graphs,
 which will be saved in the filesystem on the device. Typically, you will
 provide a list of sentences/phrases to createDecodingGraphFromSentences:forRecognizer:andSaveWithName:
 method, which will then create a custom decoding graph. Later on, you can refer
 to the custom decoding graph by its name. Alternatively, instead of list of
 sentences/phrases you can provide an ARPA language model (bundled with your app),
 which will be used to build a custom decoding graph.

 Decoding graphs can only be built dynamically if the lang/ subdirectory in the
 ASR bundle exists.
 
 @warning When dynamically creating decoding graphs, any words that do not have
 phonetic representation in the lexicon (ASRBUNDLE/lang/lexicon.txt) will be 
 assigned one algorithmically. For English langauge algorithmic representation is
 imperfect, thus you should aim to manually augment the lexicon text file with
 pronunciations for as many additional words that are likely to be encountered
 in your app. For example, if your app is dealing with ASR of names
 you would augment the lexicon with additional names and their proper 
 pronunciation before releasing your app.

 @warning In the current versio of the framework, creating of decoding graph can
 take on the order of 10-30sec (on iPhone 6 and equivalaent devices) for
 medium size vocabulary task (more than thousand words). For larger language 
 models we recommend you create decoding graph ahead of time and bundle it with
 your app.
