/*  ################## KIOSRecognizer #############*/

/** An instance of the KIOSRecognizer class, called recognizer, manages 
 recognizer resources and provides speech recognition capabilities to your 
 application.
 
 You typically initialize the engine at the app startup time by calling
 `+initWithASRBundle:` or `+initWithASRBundleAtPath:` method, and
 then use sharedInstance method when you need to access the recognizer.
 
 Recognition results are provided via callbacks. To obtain results one of your
 classes will need to adopt a 
 [KIOSRecognizerDelegate protocol](KIOSRecognizerDelegate), and implement some 
 of its methods.
 
 In order to properly handle audio interrupts you will need to implement
  [KIOSRecognizerDelegate recognizerReadyToListenAfterInterrupt:] callback method 
 in which you need to perform audio play cleanup (stop playing audio). This allows KeenASR
 SDK to properly deactivate audio session before app goes to background.
 
 You can optionally implement [KIOSRecognizerDelegate recognizerReadyToListenAfterInterrupt:] callback method, which will trigger after KIOSRecognizer is fully setup after
 app comes to the foreground. This is where you may refresh the UI state of the app.
 
 Initialization example:
 
     if (! [KIOSRecognizer sharedInstance]) {
         [KIOSRecognizer initWithASRBundle:@"librispeech-nnet2-en-us"];
     }
     // for convenience our class keeps a local reference of the recognizer
     self.recognizer = [KIOSRecognizer sharedInstance];
 
     // this class will also be implementing methods from KIOSRecognizerDelegate 
     // protocol
     self.recognizer.delegate = self;
 
     // recordings will be saved on the device
     self.recognizer.createAudioRecordings = YES;
 
     // after 0.8sec of silence, recognizer will automatically stop listening
     [self.recognizer setVADParameter:KIOSVadTimeoutEndSilenceForGoodMatch toValue:.8];

     // define callbacks for KIOSRecognizerDelegate
 
 After initialization, audio data from all sessions when recognizer is listening
 will be used for online speaker adaptation. You can name speaker adaptation
 profiles via adaptToSpeakerWithName:, persist profiles in the filesystem via
 saveSpeakerAdaptationProfile, and reset via resetSpeakerAdaptation.

 activity in your app that may entail new speaker. For example, a practice view
 is started and there is a good chance a different user may be using the app.
 
 If speaker (pseudo)identities are known, you don't need to call this method, you
 can just switch speakers by calling adaptToSpeakerWithName: with the

 Following are the tradeoffs when using this method:
 
   - the downside of resetting user profile for the existing user is that ASR
     performance will be reset to the baseline (no adaptation), which may 
     slightly degrade performance in the first few interactions
 
   - the downside of NOT resetting user profile for a new user is that, depending
     on the characteristics of the new user's voice, ASR performance may 
     initially be degraded slightly (when comparing to the baseline case of no 
     adaptation)
 
 Calls to this method will be ignored if recognizer is in LISTENING state.
 
 If you are resetting adaptation profile and you know user's (pseudo)identity, 
 you may want to call saveSpeakerAdaptationProfile method prior to calling this
