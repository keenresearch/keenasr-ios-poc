 If KIOSRecognizer.createJSONMetadata is set to NO, response json files
 will not be created on the device and there will be no metadata to transfer to
 the Dashboard. KIOSRecognizer.createAudioRecordings also needs be set to YES
 (future releases will provide ways to upload only metadata, even when audio
 recordings are not stored on the device).
 
 KIOSUploader will currently upload data as long as there is internet
 connectivity regardless of its type (WiFi, LTE, etc.). Future releases will
 provide finer control over the type of internet connectivity channels that
 should be used for uploads.
