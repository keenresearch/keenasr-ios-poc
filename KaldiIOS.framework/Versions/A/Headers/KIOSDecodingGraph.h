/** An instance of the KIOSDecodingGraph class, called decodingGraph, manages
 recognizer's decoding graph. For more details on the concept of decoding graphs
 in automated speech recognition see [this page](http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/graph.html).
 
 For ASR tasks in which domain and vocabulary are defined ahead of time and not
 dependent on information available only during the runtime, it is recommended that
 decoding graph is created offline and packaged in the ASR bundle directory.
 
 If user specific information is necessary to create decoding graphs, you can use
 KIOSDecodingGraph class to dynamically create decoding graphs which will be 
 saved in the filesystem on the device. Typically, you will provide a list of
 sentences/phrases to createDecodingGraphFromSentences:andSaveWithName: method,
 which will then create a custom decoding graph in the file system. Later on, 
 you can refer to the decodingGraph by its name. Alternatively, you can provide
 a bigram language model, which will be used to build a decoding graph.

 Using this class is conditioned on availability of the lang/ subdirectory in the
 ASR bundle.
 
 @warning When dynamically creating decoding graphs, any words that do not have
 phonetic representation in the lexicon (ASRBUNDLE/lang/lexicon.txt) will be 
 assigned one algorithmically. For English langauge algorithmic representation is
 imperfect, thus you should aim to augment the lexicon text file with 
 pronunciations for as many additional words that are likely to be encountered
 in your app. For example, if your app is dealing with ASR of names
 you would augment the lexicon with additional names and their proper 
 pronunciation.

 @warning In the current versio of the framework, creating of decodingGraph can
 take on the order of 10-15 sec for medium size vocabulary/bigrams (more than
 thousand words). We are actively working on optimizing methods that create
 decoding graphs.
