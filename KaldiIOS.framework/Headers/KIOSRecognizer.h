/** An instance of the KIOSRecognizer class, called recognizer, manages recognizer resources and provides speech recognition capabilities in your application.
 
 You typically initiate the engine at the app startup time by calling `+initWithRecognizerType:andASRBundle:andDecodingGraph:` method,  and then use sharedInstance method when you need to access the recognizer.
 
 You can implement a delegate object for a recognizer to respond to partial or final recognition results. For more details refer to KIOSRecognizerDelegate protocol,
 
 Initialization example:
 
     if (! [KIOSRecognizer sharedInstance]) {
       [KIOSRecognizer initWithRecognizerType:KIOSRecognizerTypeGMM andASRBundle:@"librispeech-gmm" andDecodingGraph:@"librispeech-gmm/HCLG.fst"];
       [KIOSRecognizer sharedInstance].createAudioRecordings = FALSE;
     }
     // our class keeps a local reference of the recognizer (not necessary)
     self.recognizer = [KIOSRecognizer sharedInstance];
     self.recognizer.delegate = self;
     self.recognizer.createAudioRecordings = YES;
 
 @warning Only a single instance of the recognizer can exist at any given time.
